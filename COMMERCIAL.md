> **Summary**
> - Source code: available under the NithronOS Community License (NCL) for **non-commercial** use and contributions.

## Ways to Use NithronOS

### 1) Personal / Non-Commercial (Free)
- Read/modify source, compile locally for personal lab use.
- Contribute PRs under NCL.
- No redistribution of binaries or hosted service offerings.

### 2) Business Internal Use (Commercial License)
- Use Official Build Artifacts or self-built binaries **inside your company**.
- Includes updates via Nithron’s signed repository.
- No redistribution or hosting for third parties.

### 3) Service Provider / Reseller (Commercial + Addendum)
- Host NithronOS for clients, manage deployments, or bundle it in your product.
- Requires an MSP/Reseller addendum (per-node pricing or revenue share).

## License Channels

### A) Patreon Subscription (Individuals/Indie)
Active Patreon subscribers get:
- Access to Official Build Artifacts (stable/nightly per tier).
- Binary EULA granting use on a limited number of nodes (e.g., Tier 1: up to 3 nodes; Tier 2: up to 10).
- Priority community support.
> Companies should use a commercial agreement instead of Patreon.

### B) Commercial Agreement (Company/MSP)
Email **licensing@nithron.com** with:
- Company name, use case (internal/MSP), expected node count, support needs.

We offer:
- Per-node or annual subscription (updates + support SLAs).
- Reseller/MSP rights (hosted service, managed deployments).
- Optional white-label branding rights.

## Trademarks & Branding
“Nithron”, “NithronOS”, “nOS”, and associated logos are Nithron’s trademarks. No right to use them is granted except to truthfully describe the Software. Forks must remove all brand assets and use a distinct name (see `TRADEMARK_POLICY.md`).

## Compliance Notes
- Do not mirror or redistribute Official Build Artifacts, keys, or the update repo.
- Do not offer NithronOS as a service without a Commercial/MSP license.
- Keep license notices intact; don’t remove attributions in source.
