# NithronOS Requirements

This document tracks product and technical requirements across subsystems. Items marked as “Follow-ups” are planned but not included in the current milestone.

## Follow-ups (not in this commit)

- Account management UI (password change, 2FA reset, regenerate recovery).
- Password reset flow (console-gated or admin-initiated).
- Audit log UI for auth events; session list & revoke.
